The projects I was tasked with involving [Python](https://www.python.org/) were called Creative Tasks. Within these assignments, we were given a set of criteria to follow, which would gradually improve our skills by drilling repeated methods into our heads. I described this in an odd way, so I hope it was at least a little possible to understand.

In [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), all of the projects were based on getting the same result of a given program. So, assuming you inputted all of your code correctly, your output should be an exact replica of the program you were given, leading you to learn information from both trial and error and asking your teacher questions.
